# Natural-Language-Processing

## In this project, I trained a Naive Bayes classifier model to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Echo product reviews. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP), I converted textual reviews into numerical data, which I then used to train the machine learning model. The goal of the project was to automatically predict customer sentiment from thousands of public reviews. This sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights to companies, helping them understand how customers perceive their products and services.
